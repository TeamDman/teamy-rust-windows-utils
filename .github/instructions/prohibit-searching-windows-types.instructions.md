You are prohibited from using search tools to attempt to find definitions from the `windows` crate.
If a statement like `use windows::Win32::Foundation::HANDLE;` is present and you wish to see the definition of `HANDLE`, you MUST ask the user to navigate to the definition and include it manually, yielding the conversation back to them.
