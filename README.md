## Windows Features

Visit https://microsoft.github.io/windows-rs/features/ to search for the features by the name of what you want to import.

Also check out https://github.com/teamdman/windows-features which is a tool I made to scan code and attempt to identify the features being used. This is useful when AI has outputted a bunch of Windows code which may rely on features you haven't enabled yet.

## Demos

```
cargo run -p tray-demo
```
